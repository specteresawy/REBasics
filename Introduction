#Vulnerabilities:
#_________________

#Generally speaking vulnerabilities are flaws in a program that are related to some sort of a situation the developer didn't consider.

#ocassionally we have protocols that actually are flawed by them selves (we might uncover some sort of a flaw in the underlying protocol )

#the vast majority of vulnerabilities that we are going to see are made by average programmers.

#THE MOST COMMON VULERNABILITY IS GOING TO BE :

#A STACK BUFFER OVERFLOW.
#so ... what is a stack bufferoverflow?

void functionFunction(char *param, int p2, float p3)
{
	char[local 1024];
	strcpy(local, param);

}

int main(int argc, char** argv):
{
	functionFunction(argv[1], 42, 3.14);
}

# in the previous program we define some sort of a buffer, so we have a buffer that we have defined, perhabs that buffer is not large enough for all possible inputs.

# This can cause bugs in the program, but when things get really bad is when a user has control over this input.

#so whenever we allow a user control over these inputs its going to be very bad in this program that was written in C:

# C is used to write nearly every OS on the planet.

# because of that we will find a lot of things such as : Stack buffer overflows and other things that can trace themselves back to the C programming language.

# The previous C program has one function which is called functionFunction and a main function , in c or C++ programms the standard main function that gets called takes two parameters, the first parameter is the number of args ( arguments ) that were passed, Traditionally we call that argc ( arg C ), you can call it whatever you want but that's what we normally call.

# And then we have an array of strings which is char** (which means its a pointer to a pointer ) because the way strings are handled in C language is to treat them as an array : that is really a simple list in memory of charachters and each charachter is normally encoded in ASCII and it takes one byte for each charachter of your string.

#All that's happening here in the function within main function is accepting input from the user, and this is a horrible program because its just calling functionFunction and doesn't check anything.

# So if we don't pass in a parameter this program will actually crash.

# we call functionFunction and take the very first argument that was passed in argv[1].

#Because these arrays are based zero, argv[0] points to the name of the program that we are running, so argv[1] is the first argument, also 42 is passed and 3.14 pi value was passed either.
